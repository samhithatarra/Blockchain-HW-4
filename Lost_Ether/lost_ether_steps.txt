1. Deploy the contract as is
2. We can call the deposit function with some amount like 10 Wei in the value box (msg.value)
3. We notice the contract's withdraw function is marked payable so it actually is able to receive/set the msg.value of the contract while also calling withdraw.
4. We take advantage of this by calling withdraw passing in a value of 10 for the function but also making the msg.value 10.
5. Now the total supply says 0 but the balance of the contract will be different because it is getting set with the value we supplied as msg.value.
